This will be a repo to house various documents

Per the tutotial, I'll write a bit about myself.

My name is Nikita Ramsey and I'm from Detroit, MI. I was born on April 25th, 1986 to Derrick Ramsey and Cornelia Christine Williams. I have two brothers, Michael and Eric. I currently have two nieces with a third on the way in March 2021. I have a soon-to-be twelve year old son named K'Dyn Jakhai. He's currently a 7th grader and is just starting the school year. This is my first year back in school and I am very excited; learning is very important to me. I hope I'm able to master quite a few things this quarter between my classes and work. I'm very optimistic.
